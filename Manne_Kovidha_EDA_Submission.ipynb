        "Uber is facing a **problem of supply-demand gap**. This happens mostly during the night and early morning hours for rides from the airport to the city. During these times, many passengers are unable to get a cab. Either no cabs are available at night, or drivers cancel rides in the early morning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis and solution ideas were already provided to me. These helped me understand the issue clearly. Based on the figures (1.1, 1.2, and 1.3), there is a clear pattern. At night, there are very **few drivers available**. In the early morning, **many drivers cancel rides**. Figure 2 shows that most cancellations happen in the early morning and morning hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis suggests two simple solutions. The first is to **give drivers extra pay (incentives)** during early morning and morning hours. This can be called rush hour pricing. It will encourage drivers to accept rides and reduce cancellations. The second solution is to **create night shifts for drivers**. This will help more cabs to be available during night hours. These two steps can reduce the gap between supply and demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, based on this background, I have to complete the remaining four tasks.\n",
        "These tasks will support the analysis and help explore the data better. The tasks include: cleaning the data in Excel, creating dashboards in Excel, using SQL to find insights, and doing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using Pandas in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step is to **clean the data using Excel**. I will remove empty rows, correct formatting issues, and make sure all time and date values are proper. This will help make the data ready for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, I will **create dashboards in Excel**. These will include graphs and charts that show how many ride requests happen at different times, when drivers cancel the most, and when cab supply is lowest. These dashboards will help visualize the gap in a clear way.\n",
        "\n",
        "After that, I will **use SQL to write simple queries**. These queries will help me find out how many ride requests were made at each hour, how many were cancelled, and how many rides were completed. I will also add comments (using --) in each query to explain what it does, in simple words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, I will **use Pandas in Python to do EDA**. This means I will explore the data further. I will group the data by hour, calculate totals and percentages, and create simple charts. This will help confirm the trends shown in the original analysis and may reveal more useful patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, the analysis and solution part was already given to me. My job now is to **work with the data and find more insights**. By cleaning the data, building dashboards, writing SQL queries, and using Pandas for EDA, I will help support the given findings. These steps will help show the problem more clearly and make the solutions more useful with the help of real data.\n",
